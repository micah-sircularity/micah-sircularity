# Micah Johnson  
Product & Engineering Hacker | 0-1 Builder |

I'm somewhere between a product manager and an AI engineer—basically your go-to 0-1 hacker who loves turning big ideas into tangible products. My journey blends philosophy, theology, and a dash of interdisciplinary studies, so I'm all about spotting hidden connections and shaping them into real-world solutions (and yes, sometimes that involves shipping revenue-generating features overnight).

- **Captain HQ (YC, NFX-backed):** Scaled a fintech product from 0 to \$1M in six months, led cross-functional teams, and built the core architecture that fueled rapid user growth.  
- **RiverGuide.ai:** Launched mobile and web apps with AI-driven features, hit \$20K revenue in under six months, and orchestrated a lean development team.  
- **Black UX Labs (Google-backed):** Engineered AI-powered job search solutions, grabbed \$50K in funding, and automated internal processes to slash time wasted on repetitive tasks.  
- **Sircularity LLC:** Consult on custom AI solutions and infrastructure for community-focused organizations—basically building the future with code and coffee.
